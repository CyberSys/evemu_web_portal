<h1>Most important changes in Crucible(March 13th, 2012)</h1>
<h2>New Tier3 Battlecruisers</h2><br>
Four new ships, forged from artwork created by our fans, introduce a powerful new rank to the battlecruiser class of starships. Pilots interested in heavier firepower without the expense of upgrading to battleship-class vessels will find the Tier 3 Battlecruisers a more than enjoyable option.<br>
<br>
<h2>V3 - A Graphical Upgrade</h2><br>
The V3 Project is the latest step forward in shader and texture quality for the ships of EVE Online, delivering crisper detailing  and finer quality to the already amazing-looking starships of New Eden.<br>
<br>
<h2>Time Dilation</h2><br>
Warring alliances in EVE often perform the extraordinary feat of amassing fleets of several hundred pilots at the same time for massive 200-1,000 ship battles. Extraordinary situations require extraordinary solutions. Time Dilation reduces the performance impact of such massive engagements, allowing for less laggy and more responsive combat environment.<br>
<br>
<h2>Improvements to the Fitting Window</h2><br>
All ship computers have now been upgraded with the ability to compute a fitting's DPS (including turrets, drones and missiles) as a single sum using a mysterious celestial force called basic mathematics. Also, the CPU and Power Grid will now display remaining amount as opposed to used amount.<br>
